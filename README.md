Pluvia, a computer game for rainy days.  
It is relaxing and does not impose time pressure.
Pluvia’s main target is to gain the highest score by keeping a steady growing pile of stones from reaching the top of the screen.  
In a Pluvia game, stones of different color drop from above onto each other to form gradually a heap that will eventually reach the top of the screen and end the game. Each stone that drops into the game screen increments the score one point.  
Whenever two or more stones of the same colour land on top of each other, they vanish and leave space for more stones to drop.  
Whenever two or more stones of the same colour land beside each other, they glue to each other and form a bar. Bars are very annoying and you will end up trying to avoid them.  
Each time some stones have dropped into the game screen, you can interact with the heap; You can click on one of the stones with the left or right mouse button to push it to the left or right. The stone will move into that direction as long as there is room, pushing any other stones with along with it.  
This way you can heap stones of same colour on top of each other to make room.  
If you do not want to move any stone, you can press the space key to force new stones to drop.  
You can exit any game using the escape button and selecting ‘Exit’ in the ‘Game Menu’. You can always continue such a game.
